This is for late-game settlers.

Colony development time (after the colony ship lands) scales with empire size. This mod adds 5 levels of society tech that improve this time by 200% each. This will cut down on the possibly decades-long development period.

Requires "Durasteel Infrastructure" and "Self-Aware Colony Ships" and being able to research repeatables.
